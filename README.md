# Working Title: AceTrainer

AceTrainer is a small website meant to help first-person shooter (FPS) players train their aim. Inspired by websites such as [Aim Trainer](aimtrainer.io), it contains a homepage, the main aim training page where the actual client-side game is run, and an about page where the users can learn about us, the creators. :D

## JS Implementation

The main JavaScript implementation will be on the webpage designated as "Aim Trainer" in the outline. As the name suggests, it will feature a game where users can play a point-and-click game to train their aim for shooter games.
